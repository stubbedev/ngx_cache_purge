# ngx_cache_purge

An nginx module that adds cache purge support for `FastCGI`, `proxy`, `SCGI`,
and `uWSGI` caches. A purge operation removes the cached entry whose key
matches the purge request. This repository maintains a fork of
[FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge), with
compatibility updates, bug fixes, and additional purge features.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/nginx-modules/ngx_cache_purge/releases)
for changes and [distribution packages](#distribution-packages) for packaged builds.

## Features

- **Inline purge** — dedicated HTTP method (`PURGE`) with IP access control
- **Separate purge location** — 3-arg `proxy_cache_purge zone key` syntax for
  regex-captured key purging without a `proxy_pass`
- **Wildcard / partial purge** — trailing `*` walks the cache directory and
  removes all matching entries
- **`purge_all`** — removes every entry in the cache zone in one request
- **Background queue** — async purge processing with configurable batch size
  and throttling so purge I/O does not block worker event loops
- **Vary-aware purge** — after an exact-key purge, removes all filesystem
  variants (gzip, Vary header) sharing the same cache key
- **Response types** — `html` (default), `json`, `xml`, `text`

Older packages with the same name may use a different upstream. Debian switched
to this fork in version `1:2.5.3-1`; Ubuntu 24.04's published package is still
based on 2.3. Check your package's source and changelog when upgrading.

Use a module build compatible with your installed NGINX package. Distribution
modules may depend on a specific NGINX version or ABI, and 2.x packages do not
provide the background queue directives introduced in 3.x.

---

### Build from source

```bash
cd /path/to/nginx-source
./configure --add-module=/path/to/ngx_cache_purge
make
make install
```

Dynamic module:

```bash
./configure --add-dynamic-module=/path/to/ngx_cache_purge
make modules
```

---

## Directives

### `proxy_cache_purge`

```
Syntax:  proxy_cache_purge on | off | <method> [purge_all] from all | <cidr> ...
         proxy_cache_purge <zone> "<key_expression>"
Default: —
Context: http, server, location
```

**Inline form** (`from …`) — intercepts the named HTTP method on a proxy
location and purges the matching cache entry. `on` is a shorthand for method
`PURGE`; `off` disables purging. Optionally restrict to a list of CIDR ranges
or use `from all` to allow from any address. Adding `purge_all` before `from`
empties the entire cache zone regardless of the request URI.

**Separate-location form** (two arguments) — use inside a dedicated purge
location (typically a regex location capturing the cache key). Looks up the
cache zone by name and purges the compiled key expression. This form is
incompatible with `proxy_cache` and `proxy_pass` in the same location.


### `fastcgi_cache_purge`

```
Syntax:  fastcgi_cache_purge on | off | <method> [purge_all] from all | <cidr> ...
         fastcgi_cache_purge <zone> "<key_expression>"
Default: —
Context: http, server, location
```

Equivalent to `proxy_cache_purge` but for FastCGI cache zones configured with
`fastcgi_cache` / `fastcgi_cache_path`.


### `scgi_cache_purge`

```
Syntax:  scgi_cache_purge on | off | <method> [purge_all] from all | <cidr> ...
         scgi_cache_purge <zone> "<key_expression>"
Default: —
Context: http, server, location
```

Equivalent to `proxy_cache_purge` but for SCGI cache zones configured with
`scgi_cache` / `scgi_cache_path`.


### `uwsgi_cache_purge`

```
Syntax:  uwsgi_cache_purge on | off | <method> [purge_all] from all | <cidr> ...
         uwsgi_cache_purge <zone> "<key_expression>"
Default: —
Context: http, server, location
```

Equivalent to `proxy_cache_purge` but for uWSGI cache zones configured with
`uwsgi_cache` / `uwsgi_cache_path`.


### `cache_purge_response_type`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_response_type html | json | xml | text
Default: html
Context: http, server, location
```

Sets the `Content-Type` and body format of purge responses. Has no effect on
cache-miss responses (412 / 404), which are generated by nginx's built-in
error-page renderer.


### `cache_purge_background_queue`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_background_queue on | off
Default: off
Context: http
```

When enabled, wildcard and `purge_all` purge requests are enqueued and return
`202 Accepted` immediately; a per-worker background timer drains the queue in
batches. Has no effect on exact-key purges, which are always synchronous. When
disabled, all purges are processed synchronously in the request handler.


### `cache_purge_queue_size`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_queue_size <number>
Default: 1024
Context: http
```

Maximum number of entries the background queue can hold. Each slot occupies
roughly 1–2 KB of shared memory (2048 slots ≈ 3 MB). When the queue is full,
new wildcard / `purge_all` purge requests are answered `429 Too Many
Requests` -- never walked synchronously in the request worker. Duplicates of a
queued purge are recognised by hash and not queued twice. Only meaningful when
`cache_purge_background_queue on`.


### `cache_purge_batch_size`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_batch_size <number>
Default: 10
Context: http
```

How many queued purges of one cache are carried out together, by a single
walk of its directory (or, with `cache_purge_index`, a single pass over the
index). All patterns are matched at once -- one binary search per file over
the sorted, prefix-free set -- so a pass costs about the same for one purge as
for thousands; set it as high as `cache_purge_queue_size`. Only meaningful
when `cache_purge_background_queue on`.


### `cache_purge_walk_budget`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_walk_budget <time>
Default: 20ms
Context: http
```

How long a background walk (and a key index build) runs before it yields to
the event loop; it resumes on the next tick, `cache_purge_throttle_ms` later.
`0` walks a whole directory in one tick.


### `cache_purge_queue_timeout`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_queue_timeout <time>
Default: 0
Context: http
```

Queued purges older than this are dropped (and logged). `0`: never -- a
dropped purge leaves stale content.


### `cache_purge_index`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_index <size>
Default: 0 (off)
Context: http
Requires: cache_purge_background_queue on
```

Keeps every key stored in any cache in a shared-memory index of this size, so
that a wildcard or `purge_all` purge is a range lookup plus exact deletes
instead of a directory walk: its cost follows the files it matches, not the
size of the cache.

* Entries are recorded when an upstream response is about to be stored,
  subrequests (slices, background updates) and both Vary file names
  included, and checked again when the request ends: an entry without a file
  is dropped, a stored file without an entry gets one.
* After a (re)start the index is built from the files on disk, in parallel
  by all workers (a reload keeps it). Wildcards during the build are applied
  to what is indexed and to the rest as the walk reaches it, and answered
  `202`.
* Size it at ~170-260 bytes per cached file (the key length decides). If it
  runs full, a `crit` line is logged and wildcards fall back to the queued
  walks until the index has been reconciled and rebuilt.
* The queue and the index are locked with their slab pool's mutex, which the
  master releases when a worker dies; a worker that dies in the middle of a
  change resets the zone (the index is rebuilt from disk) rather than leave
  it inconsistent.

Answers: `200` purged (up to `cache_purge_index_sync_limit` files, deleted
before the answer), `202` more than that (the rest in the background) or
during a build, `404`/`412` nothing matched, `429` could not be queued, `400`
a wildcard key too long (512 bytes) to match.


### `cache_purge_index_sync_limit`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_index_sync_limit <number>
Default: 1024
Context: http
```

Matching files an indexed wildcard deletes before answering; more are deleted
in the background and the answer is `202`.


### `cache_purge_index_reconcile`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_index_reconcile <time>
Default: 10m
Context: http
```

How often entries of files the cache manager expired or evicted are dropped
(a walk of the index in memory, not of the disk; it waits for the cache
loader after a start). Also how often a failed index is retried.


### `cache_purge_index_refresh`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_index_refresh <time>
Default: 0 (off)
Context: http
```

How often the cache directories are walked, gently, for files the index does
not know -- restored or copied in from outside, or lost by a process killed
at the wrong moment. The walk only adds entries, so it is always safe; it
logs a `warn` with the count when it had to add any.


### `cache_purge_throttle_ms`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_throttle_ms <time>
Default: 10ms
Context: http
```

Interval between background processing ticks. Accepts any nginx time value:
`10ms`, `500ms`, `1s`, `2s 500ms`. Only meaningful when
`cache_purge_background_queue on`.

Increase on constrained or spinning-disk storage; decrease on NVMe.

**Time-unit note:** a bare integer with no suffix (e.g. `10`) is interpreted
as milliseconds — matching the `_ms` directive name — and a startup warning is
logged. Use an explicit `ms` suffix (`10ms`) to silence the warning. This
differs from most nginx time directives, where a bare integer means seconds.


### `cache_purge_legacy_status`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_legacy_status on | off
Default: on
Context: http
```

Controls the HTTP status code returned when a purge request targets an entry
that is not in the cache:

| value | status on miss            |
|-------|---------------------------|
| `on`  | `412 Precondition Failed` |
| `off` | `404 Not Found`           |

Default is `on` (412) for backwards compatibility with earlier releases.
Set to `off` to return `404 Not Found`, the correct HTTP status for a
resource that does not exist (RFC 9110 §15.5.5).


### `cache_purge_vary_aware`

```
Syntax:  cache_purge_vary_aware on | off
Default: off
Context: http
```

When `on`, an exact-key purge walks the cache directory after deleting the
primary file and removes any remaining files that carry the same `KEY:` string.
This covers all `Vary` and `gzip_vary` variants of a cached response, which
are stored at different filesystem paths but share one logical key. The byte
immediately after the key string in each file is verified to be `\n`,
preventing false matches against keys that share only a common prefix.

Disabled by default because it adds a full cache directory walk per exact-key
purge. Enable it when `gzip_vary on` or `Vary:` headers cause multiple cache
files to be created for a single logical entry. Wildcard and `purge_all`
purges do not need this option — the walk they already perform catches every
variant regardless.

---

## Partial key purge

When the exact cache key is not known — for example because it includes cookie
values or query parameters — append `*` to the key to request a prefix match:

```
PURGE /images/header*
```

The `*` must be the last character of the URI. Ensure `$uri` appears at the
**end** of `proxy_cache_key` when using this feature, otherwise the prefix
match will not align with the stored key.

---

## Sample configurations

### Basic — inline purge method

```nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx keys_zone=main:10m;

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass        http://backend;
            proxy_cache       main;
            proxy_cache_key   "$host$uri$is_args$args";
            proxy_cache_purge PURGE from 127.0.0.1;
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
curl -X PURGE http://localhost/images/logo.png
# 200 — entry purged
# 412 — entry not in cache  (or 404 with cache_purge_legacy_status off)
# 403 — client IP not in the allowed list
```

### Basic — separate purge location

```nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx keys_zone=main:10m;

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass      http://backend;
            proxy_cache     main;
            proxy_cache_key "$host$uri$is_args$args";
        }

        # Capture the cache key from the URI and pass it to the 3-arg form.
        # No proxy_pass or proxy_cache required in this location.
        location ~ ^/purge(/.*) {
            allow             127.0.0.1;
            deny              all;
            proxy_cache_purge main "$host$1$is_args$args";
        }
    }
}
```

### Background queue enabled

```nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx keys_zone=main:10m;

    cache_purge_background_queue on;
    cache_purge_queue_size        2048;
    cache_purge_batch_size        20;
    cache_purge_throttle_ms       10ms;

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass        http://backend;
            proxy_cache       main;
            proxy_cache_key   "$host$uri$is_args$args";
            proxy_cache_purge PURGE from 127.0.0.1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Purge all entries

```nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx keys_zone=main:10m;

    server {
        location /content {
            proxy_pass        http://backend;
            proxy_cache       main;
            proxy_cache_key   "$host$uri$is_args$args";
            proxy_cache_purge PURGE purge_all from 127.0.0.1;
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
curl -X PURGE http://localhost/anything
# 200 — entire cache zone cleared
```

### JSON responses with per-location override

```nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx keys_zone=main:10m;

    cache_purge_background_queue on;

    server {
        cache_purge_response_type json;   # default for all locations in this server
        location / {
            proxy_pass        http://backend;
            proxy_cache       main;
            proxy_cache_key   "$host$uri$is_args$args";
            proxy_cache_purge PURGE from all;
        }

        location /admin/purge {
            # Override to plain text for scripting
            cache_purge_response_type text;
            proxy_cache_purge         main "$arg_key";
        }
    }
}
```

### Vary-aware purge

```nginx
http {
    cache_purge_vary_aware on;
    gzip_vary              on;
}
```

After purging a key, all gzip and Vary variants stored at different filesystem
paths are also removed automatically.

---

## Performance tuning

The appropriate values depend on storage type, cached file count, and purge
request rate. The table below gives reasonable starting points.

| Environment | `queue_size` | `batch_size` | `throttle_ms` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small VPS — 1–2 cores, ≤ 2 GB RAM | 512 | 5 | 25ms |
| Mid-range VDS — 4–8 cores, SSD | 2048 | 20 | 10ms |
| Dedicated server — 16+ cores, NVMe | 8192 | 50 | 5ms |
| High purge rate, any hardware | 8192 | 5 | 50ms |

**Queue memory:** `queue_size × ~1.5 KB`. 2048 slots ≈ 3 MB of shared memory.

**Throughput ceiling:** `batch_size ÷ throttle_ms_value × 1000` purges/sec, where
`throttle_ms_value` is the numeric millisecond count (e.g. `10` for `10ms`). At
defaults: `10 ÷ 10 × 1000 = 1 000/s`. On spinning disk or network storage,
keep `batch_size` low and `throttle_ms` high to avoid iowait spikes.

---

## Monitoring and debugging

Successful background purges return `202 Accepted`. The response body uses the
format set by `cache_purge_response_type`.

Relevant log messages:

| Level   | Condition                          |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| `warn`  | Queue full; item timed out in queue |
| `error` | Cache zone not found               |
| `crit`  | File deletion failed               |

```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log | grep "cache purge"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Purge requests block worker processes**
Enable `cache_purge_background_queue on`.

**Queue full warnings in the log**
Increase `cache_purge_queue_size`, or reduce the purge request rate.

**High iowait during purges**
Decrease `cache_purge_batch_size` and increase `cache_purge_throttle_ms`.

**Queue drains too slowly**
Increase `cache_purge_batch_size` and decrease `cache_purge_throttle_ms`.

**`412` responses where `404` is expected**
Set `cache_purge_legacy_status off`.

**Vary / gzip variants remain after purge**
Enable `cache_purge_vary_aware on`.

---

## Testing

The test suite uses [Test::Nginx](https://github.com/openresty/test-nginx).

```bash
prove -r t/
```

Individual suites:

```bash
prove t/basic.t
prove t/background_queue.t
prove t/config.t
prove t/memory.t
prove t/performance.t
```

See [`t/TESTING.md`](t/TESTING.md) for Docker-based testing and the full
testing guide.

---

## Migration

### From the original FRiCKLE module

The module is backwards compatible. No configuration changes are required.
To opt in to background processing, add:

```nginx
http {
    cache_purge_background_queue on;
}
```

### From nginx-selective-cache-purge-module

Replace the module. Background queue functionality is now built in. Map your
previous queue parameters to `cache_purge_queue_size`, `cache_purge_batch_size`,
and `cache_purge_throttle_ms`.

---

## Security

- Restrict purge endpoints with `allow` / `deny` directives or an upstream
  authentication layer. Never expose them publicly.
- Set `cache_purge_queue_size` to a value appropriate for your traffic to
  limit shared memory consumption under request floods.
- Consider pairing purge locations with `limit_req` to rate-limit purge
  requests independently of normal traffic.

## Technical and historical notes

- The original default branch ends on [23 December 2014](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge/commit/331fe43e8d9a3d1fa5e0c9fec7d3201d431a9177). As of this check, twelve full years have not elapsed.
- **Avoid “fully non-blocking.”** The queue callback still calls `ngx_walk_tree` synchronously. Deferring a purge does not remove its filesystem cost. Exact-key purges remain synchronous; enabling `Vary` handling adds a directory scan.
- **Do not promise unchanged behavior for every upgrade.** The 2.5 status-code change alone makes that inaccurate. Release 3.0.0 also flags internal breaking changes.
- **Describe CI configuration accurately.** The checked workflow targets NGINX 1.20.2, 1.26.3, 1.28.2, and 1.29.6. This research did not run the test suite or establish compatibility with every newer NGINX version.
- **Keep package links factual.** Downstream packaging demonstrates use of the source, not endorsement, an audit, or a support commitment from that distribution to this repository.
